    <Description>A set of common auxiliary, often necessary functions that facilitate work in Unity and are necessary in any project. These include: finding the arithmetic mean, quickly concluding the text in various kinds of brackets, converting a numerical value to a text value with filling with zeros. For example, the number 56 in the five-digit version will look like 00056, and in the eight-digit version 00000056. Other similar minor auxiliary functions will also be added to this library in the future.</Description>
